.SH DESCRIPTION
.B citron 
is a XFree86 input driver for 
.I Citron Infrared Touch
devices.
.PP
The
.B citron
driver acts as a pointer input device, and may be used as the
X server's core pointer. It is connected via a "RS232" with the host.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
At the moment the following touches are supported. They are also
available as 
.I ZPress
touches.
 
.B IRT6I5-V2.x
 6.5 inch Infrared Touch

.B IRT10I4-V4.x
 10.4 inch Infrared Touch

.B IRT12I1-V2.x
 12.1 inch Infrared Touch

.B IRT15I1-V1.x 
 15.1 inch Infrared Touch

.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to XF86Config(5x) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
For better understanding please read also the 
.B CTS
and various
.B IRT
manuals which are available in "pdf" format from Citron web page 
.B www.citron.de
or directly from Citron.

.B Sleep-Mode
If the IRT is in 
.I Doze-Mode
and Touch Zone is not interrupted for another 
certain span of time, the so-called
.I Sleep-Mode
is activated. The 
.I Sleep-Mode
decreases the scan rate of the beams even further than
the 
.I Doze-Mode
does (see below). This way the life expectancy of the beams is 
prolonged and the power consumption of the IRT is reduced. 
As soon as an interruption of the Touch Zone is detected, the 
.I Sleep-Mode
is deactivated and the Touch Zone will again be scanned with 
the maximum speed. With the Sleep-Mode activated, 
depending on the set scan rate the IRT's response time can be
considerably longer as in normal operation. If, for example, 
a scan rate of 500 ms / scan is set, it may last up to a half 
of a second until the IRT detects the interruption and deactivates 
the 
.I Sleep-Mode.
