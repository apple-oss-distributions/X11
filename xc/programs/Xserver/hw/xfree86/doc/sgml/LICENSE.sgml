<sect>Introduction
<p>
XFree86&trade; code without an explicit copyright or not explicitly
marked as being in the public domain is covered by the XFree86 1.0
copyright/license as shown <ref name="below" id="xf10">.  Portions of code are
covered by other licenses/copyrights, as shown in subsequent sections.
In all cases, see individual source files for specific license details,
copyright owner information, and copyright dates.

<sect>XFree86 Project Licensing Policy
<p>
The XFree86 Project's basic licensing philosophy has always been summed
up as "You can do what you like with the code except claim you wrote
it."  Expressed more formally, it means that the licenses acceptable
for code that makes up XFree86 must meet the following conditions:

<itemize>
<item>The code must be redistributable by others in either source or
	binary form.

<item>Others must be permitted to modify the code, and to distribute
	modified code or derived code without being required to pay a
	licensing fee or other financial consideration to the copyright
	holder.

<item>Others must be permitted to distribute binary-only forms of the
	code if they which to do so.
</itemize>

A range of Open Source and Free Software licenses meet these conditions.
The licenses in this document are examples of acceptable licenses.
Contributors to XFree86 are encouraged to choose the license type that
best suits them.  If you have any questions about whether a specific license
fits in with the XFree86 licensing policy, please contact us.

<sect>License Classifications
<p>
<sect1>Open Source
<p>
With one possible exception, we believe that all of the code in this
release (&relvers;) of XFree86 meet the requirements of the <url name="Open
Source Definition" url="http://opensource.org/docs/definition.php">, as
maintained by the <url name="Open Source Initiative (OSI)"
url="http://opensource.org/">.

The one exception is a file containing font decompression code
(<tt>xc/lib/font/fontfile/decompress.c</tt>) which contains a licence
that does not explicitly give permission to make modifications.  This
file has been part of the X11 sample implementation since at least X11R5,
and has been present in all versions of XFree86.

<sect1>Free Software
<p>

We believe that most of the code in this release (&relvers;) of XFree86
meets the requirements of the <url name="Free Software definition"
url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"> as defined by the <url
name="Free Software Foundation (FSF)" url="http://www.fsf.org/">.

The exceptions, aside from the font decompression code mentioned in the
previous section, are the GLX extension and CID font code that are
covered by the <ref name="SGI Free Software License B, version 1.1"
id="sgi">.

<sect1>GPL-compatible
<p>

The client-side X libraries distributed with this release (&relvers;),
with the exception of the GL, GLU, and GLw libraries, carry a subset of
the acceptable licenses that satisfy an additional condition: they are
GPL-compatible.  The GL, GLU, and GLw libraries contain code covered by
the <ref name="SGI Free Software License B, version 1.1" id="sgi">,
which is not GPL-compatible.

Other portions of XFree86, including the X servers, may include code
with licenses that are not GPL-compatible.  Example of such licenses
include some of the <ref name="BSD-style licenses" id="bsd">, the
<ref name="FreeType License" id="ftl">, the <ref name="SGI licenses"
id="sgi"> and the <ref name="XFree86 License version 1.1" id="xf11">.


<sect>XFree86 License (version 1.1)<label id="xf11">
<p>
The text of the XFree86 1.1 license is included below.  A FAQ for this
licence can be found at the <url name="XFree86 web site"

in Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any
and all redistributions of Covered Code.  For distributions of the

can include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and
a copy of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral
where the Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described.
Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original
Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions
of Covered Code.

3.2. <bf>Alternative License.</bf>  Provided that Recipient is in
compliance with the terms of this license, Recipient may, so long as
without derogation of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code,
distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code
under (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for
only such changes are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as
licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of the Recipient's
choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that
the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12,
and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms
of such license.  If Recipient elects to use any license other than this
License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms
which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not
by SGI.  It is emphasized that this License is a limited license, and
regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in accordance with
this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such rights, in Original
Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually been granted by SGI
in this License.

3.3. <bf>Indemnity.</bf> Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for
any liability incurred by SGI as a result of any alternative license
terms Recipient offers.

4. <bf>Termination.</bf>  This License and the rights granted hereunder

fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof.  Any sublicense to
the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination
of this License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense.
Provisions that, but their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License, shall survive.

5. <bf>No Trademark Or Other Rights.</bf>  This License does not grant
any rights to: (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall
any other rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by
implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code;
(ii) any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including
without limitation any related right for purposes of endorsement or
promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior
written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the
Original Code, which shall at all times remain with SGI.  All rights in
the Original Code not expressly granted under this License are reserved.

6. <bf>Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement.</bf>  There are various
worldwide laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to
dispositions of Covered Code, including without limitation export,
re-export, and import control laws, regulations, and executive orders,
of the U.S. government and other countries, and Recipient is reminded
it is obliged to obey such laws, regulations, and executive orders.
Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes
(directly or contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind
of any other person or entity of (ii) breaches any representation or
warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which under any applicable
law, it might be deemed to have been subject.

7. <bf>Claims of Infringement.</bf>  If Recipient learns of any third
party claim that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality
wholly or partially infringes the third party's intellectual property
rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.

8. <bf>Versions of the License.</bf> SGI may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing
version number.  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license,
continue to use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version published
bi SGI.  Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License,
only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under
this License.

           or any previous Modification shall not be deemed a Modification, 
           even if such software files are aggregated as part of a product, 
           or in any medium of storage, with any file that does contain 
           Original Software or any previous Modification.
</quote>

  2. License Terms. All distribution of the Subject Software must be made
     subject to the terms of this License. A copy of this License and the 
     Required Notice must be included in any documentation for Subject 
     Software where Recipient's rights relating to Subject Software and/or
     any Accompanying Technology are described. Distributions of Subject 
     Software in source code form must also include the Required Notice in 
     every file distributed. In addition, a ReadMe file entitled "Important
     Legal Notice" must be distributed with each distribution of one or more
     files that incorporate Subject Software. That file must be included with 
     distributions made in both source code and executable form. A copy of 
     the License and the Required Notice must be included in that file.
     Recipient may distribute Accompanying Technology under a license of
     Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
     provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this 
     License, (ii) such other license terms do not modify or supersede the 
     terms of this License as applicable to the Subject Software, (iii) 
     Recipient hereby indemnifies SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a
     result of the distribution of Accompanying Technology or the use of 
     other license terms.

  3. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
     terminate automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein
     and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any 
     sublicense to the Subject Software that is properly granted shall 
     survive any termination of this License absent termination by the terms
     of such sublicense. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
     effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

  4. Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any 
     trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, 
     trademark or service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote 
     products derived from or incorporating any Subject Software without 
     prior written permission of SGI.

  5. No Other Rights. No rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder 
     shall arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise. Title to and 
     ownership of the Original Software at all times remains with SGI. All 
     rights in the Original Software not expressly granted under this 
     License are reserved.

  6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
     applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution
     of the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and 
     import control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other 
     countries. Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any
     way infringes (directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent,
     copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights
     of any kind) of any other person or entity, or (ii) breaches any 
     representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, which under
     any applicable law it might be deemed to have been distributed. 

  7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any 
     one or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, 
     distribution, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular
     functionality or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the 
     third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient must place in a
     well-identified web page bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of 
     each such claim and a description of the party making each such claim in
     sufficient detail that a user of the Subject Software will know whom to 
     contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining such knowledge of any 
     such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web
     page in the Required Notice, and in the text of any related 
     documentation, license agreement or collateral in which Recipient 
     describes end user's rights relating to the Subject Software. If
     Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject Software 
     available to any other person or entity, Recipient shall take other 
     steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) 
     reasonably calculated to provide such knowledge to those who received
     the Subject Software.

  8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
     BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS 
     FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
     NON-INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
     OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI

     LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
     UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

     BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN 
     ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
     CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
     THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
     LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
     APPLY TO RECIPIENT TO THE EXTENT SO DISALLOWED. 

 10. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, 
     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this 
     License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold SGI and its 
     successors and assigns harmless from and against any loss, liability, 
     damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of reasonable

     reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of any 
     representation or warranty made by Recipient.

     consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined
     in title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S. Government
     End Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are 
     subject to the terms of this License.

 12. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
     subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
     unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority having proper 
     jurisdiction with respect thereto, such provision shall be reformed so 
     as to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the 
     original provision and the remainder of this License will remain in 
     effect. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
     with the laws of the United States and the State of California as 
     applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within 
     California between California residents. Any litigation relating to 
     this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
     Federal Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent 
     subject matter jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of
     California), with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, 
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and 
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
