This is a modified version of the XonX / XDarwin rootless X11
environment for OS X.

The rootless X server was derived from the HEAD of cvs.xfree86.org as
of 2002-10-08. The rest of the tree is currently from the XFree86 4.3.0
release


Compiling
=========

Don't use the top-level Makefile, it's only there for B&I. Instead, the
usual way to build everything the first time is:

	$ ./build.sh

This will build and install everything in the correct order. Running it
again will only rebuild things that have changed, unless you invoke it
with the "-c" option to start a clean build.


Running X11
===========

Launch the X11.app installed in /Applications/Utilities. It creates
Xauth session keys and then launches the X server (called Xquartz).

Xquartz subsequently completes the initialization process by running
your .xinitrc script (using /bin/sh). If .xinitrc doesn't exist Xquartz
spawns the window manager (quartz-wm) and an xterm.
